## Documentation

This project is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com) framework. It contains two apps:

- home

I use the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to style the application as well as OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS) to style the components.

### Home

This app is made for all the users. It contains views for the doctor's home page, and the patient's home page. It also contains the chat between doctor and patient, and all the related views (prescriptions, diseases, treatments, etc.).

### Login_signup
